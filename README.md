# Web_scrapping

Overview

This project is designed to scrape data from a specified website and save the relevant information in a structured format (e.g., CSV, Excel, or database). The scraper fetches data from HTML tables, divs, or other elements based on the target website's structure.

Requirements

Before running the scraper, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
Required Python libraries (listed below)

Required Python Libraries
You can install the required libraries using pip. Here are the most common ones:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas lxml
requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
beautifulsoup4: For parsing and extracting data from HTML pages.
pandas: For storing and manipulating the scraped data.
lxml: For faster parsing (optional, but recommended).

How It Works

1. Making an HTTP Request: The script uses the requests library to send an HTTP request to the target URL.
2. Parsing the HTML: Once the page is fetched, the content is parsed using BeautifulSoup to find the required elements (e.g., tables, rows, or divs).
3. Extracting Data: The script extracts relevant data from the parsed HTML using BeautifulSoup methods like find_all(), find(), or CSS selectors.
4. Storing Data: The extracted data is stored in a pandas DataFrame or another suitable data structure, and then saved to a file.
5. Running in a Loop (Optional): If you're scraping data across multiple pages or sources, the script can be modified to loop through multiple URLs or paginate automatically.
